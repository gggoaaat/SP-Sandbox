# jquery.responsiveiframes

Make all your Iframes responsive, no hassle.

Add `<script type="text/javascript" src="jquery.responsiveiframes-min.js"></script>` to your code, and all your `<iframe>`s will become responsive.  
Yes, this includes Youtube embeds.

If there's a specific Iframe that you'd like to leave untouched - you can give it the class `"no-aspect-ratio"`.
